> The best crypto you've never heard of, brought to you by [Phil Rogaway]

A misuse resistant symmetric encryption library designed to support
authenticated encryption of individual messages, encryption keys,
message streams, or large files using the [AES-SIV] ([RFC 5297]),
[AES-PMAC-SIV], and [STREAM] constructions.

Miscreant is available for several programming languages, including
[C#], [Go], [JavaScript], [Python], [Ruby], and [Rust].

## What is Miscreant?

**Miscreant** is a set of interoperable libraries implemented in several
languages providing a high-level API for misuse-resistant symmetric encryption.
Additionally, it provides support for "online" [authenticated encryption] use
cases such as streaming or incrementally encryption/decryption of large files.

The following algorithms are provided by **Miscreant**:

* [AES-SIV]: an [authenticated] mode of AES which provides
  [nonce reuse misuse resistance]. Described in [RFC 5297], it combines the
  [AES-CTR] ([NIST SP 800-38A]) mode of encryption with the
  [AES-CMAC]([NIST SP 800-38B]) function for integrity.

* [AES-PMAC-SIV]: a fully parallelizable variant of **AES-SIV** which
  substitutes the [AES-PMAC] function for integrity, providing effectively
  identical security properties as the original construction, but much better
  performance on systems which provide parallel hardware implementations of
  AES, namely Intel/AMD CPUs.

* [STREAM]: a construction which, when combined with **AES-SIV** or
  **AES-PMAC-SIV**, provides online/streaming [authenticated] encryption
  and defends against reordering and truncation attacks.

â€  Assumes hardware acceleration for the AES block cipher function

â€¡ Work is underway in the IRTF CFRG to provide an informational RFC for **AES-GCM-SIV**.
  For more information, see [draft-irtf-cfrg-gcmsiv].
  When standardization work around **AES-GCM-SIV** is complete, it will be
  [considered for inclusion in this library](https://github.com/miscreant/miscreant/issues/60).

## Key Rap

The paper describing AES-SIV,
[Deterministic Authenticated-Encryption: A Provable-Security Treatment of the Key-Wrap Problem]
contains this explanatory rap song at the end, which goes out to all the
chronic IV misusing miscreants in the land:

> Yo! Weâ€™z gonnaâ€™ take them keys anâ€™ whatever you pleaze<br>
> We gonnaâ€™ wrap â€™em all up looks like some ranâ€™om gup<br>
> Make somethinâ€™ gnarly and funky wonâ€™t fool no half-wit junkie<br>
> So the gameâ€™s like AE but thereâ€™s one major hitch<br>
> No coins can be pitched thereâ€™s no state to enrich<br>
> the IVâ€™s in a ditch dead drunk on cheap wine<br>
> Now NIST and X9 and their friends at the fort<br>
> suggest that you stick it in a six-layer torte<br>
> S/MIME has a scheme thereâ€™s even one more<br>
> So many ways that itâ€™s hard to keep score<br>
> And maybe they work and maybe theyâ€™re fine<br>
> but I want some proofs for spendinâ€™ my time<br>
> After wrappinâ€™ them keys gonnaâ€™ help out some losers<br>
> chronic IV abusers donâ€™t read no directions<br>
> risk a deadly infection If a rusty IVâ€™s drippinâ€™ into yoâ€™ veins<br>
> and ya never do manage to get it exchanged<br>
> Then we got ya somethinâ€™ and it comes at low cost<br>
> When you screw up again not all â€™ill be lost
